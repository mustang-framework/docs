# Components

In the Container layer of [Porto](https://apiato.io/docs/architecture-concepts/porto#container), you will find a comprehensive range of [predefined Components](https://github.com/Mahmoudz/Porto#components), each with its specific responsibility. It is imperative to organize all your code within these Components to ensure proper structure and organization.

Mustang offers an [extensive list](components.md) of these Components, accompanied by detailed guidelines for their utilization. Adhering to these guidelines is crucial to ensure a streamlined development process.

Components play a pivotal role in maintaining consistency throughout your codebase and enhancing its maintainability. They provide a clear and structured approach, making it easier to locate and manage individual code snippets.

Leveraging these Components enables you to construct a modular and reusable codebase, simplifying future maintenance and facilitating modifications when needed.

Components in Porto are categorized into two types: Main Components and Optional Components.

### Main Components[​](https://apiato.io/docs/architecture-concepts/components#main-components) <a href="#main-components" id="main-components"></a>

[Main Components](https://apiato.io/docs/components/main-components/) are essential for the Container's functionality and must be used to achieve its core purpose.

### Optional Components[​](https://apiato.io/docs/architecture-concepts/components#optional-components) <a href="#optional-components" id="optional-components"></a>

[Optional Components](https://apiato.io/docs/components/optional-components/) offer additional functionality that can be incorporated into the Container. Their usage is discretionary, depending on specific requirements.
