# Code Generator

Mustang comes with a powerful code generator that can help you generate all the boilerplate code for your containers. The Mustang code generator is a valuable tool that can significantly accelerate the development process by automating the creation of boilerplate code based on user inputs. For example, with the `mustang:generate:container` command, you can quickly generate a complete container with fully functional CRUD operations, complete with test coverage.

To access the latest list of code generator commands you may run the following command:

```bash
php artisan list mustang:generate
```

### Stub Customization[​](https://apiato.io/docs/framework-features/code-generator#stub-customization) <a href="#stub-customization" id="stub-customization"></a>

The mustang`:generate` commands utilize "stub" files that are pre-filled with values based on your input. If you wish to make modifications to the files generated by Mustang, you can create your own custom stub files and place them in the `app/Ship/Generators/CustomStubs` directory. These custom stubs will then override the default stubs used by Mustang. However, it is crucial to adhere to one essential rule:

* The name of the file and the folder structure in `app/Ship/Generators/CustomStubs` MUST exactly match those in `vendor/mustang/core/Generator/Stubs`.

To illustrate the process, let's assume you want to customize the creation of an `action`. Follow these steps:

1. Locate the `action.stub` file in `vendor/mustang/core/Generator/Stubs/actions`.
2. Copy the `action.stub` file and paste it into the `app/Ship/Generators/CustomStubs/actions` directory.
3. Make the desired changes to the copied `action.stub` file according to your requirements.

By completing these steps, whenever you run the `php artisan mustang:generate:action` command, your customized stub file will be employed instead of the default one, applying your modifications to the generated `action` files.
