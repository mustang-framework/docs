# Etag

The **ETag** or **entity tag** is part of HTTP, the protocol for the World Wide Web. It is one of several mechanisms that HTTP provides for Web cache validation, which allows a client to make conditional requests.

You can read more about this feature in the [Requests](https://apiato.io/docs/components/main-components/requests#etag) documentation.
