# Role Based Access Control

Mustang provides a Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) through its Authorization Container. Behind the scenes, Mustang uses the [Laravel Permission](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-permission) package.

You can read more about this feature in the [Authorization](../security/authorization.md) documentation.
